h2. AssetLoader

Multi file/asset loader for AS3 built on AS3Signals.

h3. Overview

AssetLoader provides an easy way to load multiple files. Assetloader does not use events; instead it uses "AS3Signals":http://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals.

h3. Some Features

Please check out the "wiki section":http://github.com/Matan/AssetLoader/wiki for more information and examples.

* Automatic Type detection.
* Multiple connections, which you can define = faster loading = less waiting = happier users.
* **No Events, AS3Signals only.**
* No singletons! Construct as many AssetLoaders as you want!
* Data is dispatched with strong types. NO CASTING!
* Endless recursive group loaders within loaders, within loaders, etc.
* Pause/Resume/Destroy capabilities.
* Dynamic parameter system that works with code completion - No guessing!
* Loader parameters smartly inherit from their parent loaders, which mean you write less code.
* Real-time loading stats. This provides latency, speed, average and progress of all downloads.
* Consolidated stats, loaders reclusively consolidate loading stats all the way down to the last child.
* Can be configured via XML, straight up or from an external file with one easy call.
* All loader errors are consolidated to one signal. IOError, SecurityError, etc. - you don't have to worry about it, they all boil down to one place. Which means you can "globally" handle loading errors with one listener/command.
* Interfaces all round.
* Unit tested! :D
* Works super well with "Robotlegs":http://www.robotlegs.org! //what doesnâ€™t :P
* And some other stuff too!
